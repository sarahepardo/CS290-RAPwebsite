Russell already had a packed day with going to the park in the morning but un-noticed by parents he stuck it through and eagerly made his way ALL THE WAY up FOUR LEVEL staircase. That did not stop, no sir-y! Huffing and puffing, he still had energy to check out close of kin's apartment unit. There was plenty of water and time for this tired pup to relax. After awhile, he was on his merry way back to the car; BUT for the first time ever! He got on an elevator. Oh what an experience that was once he notice this strange device. The confused look he had was so funny :)</div></div>

He loves to fool around and get random pets from people he doesn't	know (that sweetheart). Luckily, he has the constant entourage of his reasonable human mom and lovable grandma. Showing him all the love and encouragement to attempt new lessons and learn. For his classes, there are suppose to be 4 enrolled pup-students but only half the class attends! Luckily Russell makes sure to be ready by the door for anything(because he just likes going out of the house especially to the park!!!); once you put that harness on him with the leash, he KNOWS he is going out.</div></div>
